Build system specialized for building IntensiGame-based J2ME and J2SE applications.

h1. Description

IntensiBuild is a light weight build system for creating J2ME applications. It uses a small set of Ruby scripts with a generic Ant build file to create device-specific builds.

It is usually enough to have the IntensiBuild snapshot in your project under the relative path <code>modules/IntensiBuild</code> and create a small build.xml in you project root that imports the main build.xml from the IntensiBuild snapshot:

<pre>
<code>
        <project name="Example" default="build">
            <import file="modules/IntensiBuild/build.xml"/>
        </project>
</code>
</pre>

For creating IntensiBuild releases of your application, you have to create configuration files. At least one file should be present under for example <code>config/Example.rb</code>:

<pre>
<code>
        # Name of the resulting jar/jad bundle (no special chars).
        @name = "Example"

        # Possible targets are defined in file _targets.rb.
        @targets = [ Generic_MIDP2, Nokia_MIDP2 ]

        # Possible sizes correspond to the image folders in the res directory.
        # You may use arbitrary folder names (no spaces or special chars) here -
        # as long as they exist.
        @sizes = [ "Default" ]

        # Use this to activate global - not target-specific - settings. Used
        # primarly for debug output and effects.
        @symbols = []
</code>
</pre>

The build system assumes there is a resource folder available with a structure matching the values given in the configuration file. If you name your project "Example" and build for a screen size "Default", the resource folder would need to look like:

<pre>
<code>
        res/Example/Default/
</code>
</pre>

Finally you need to define some default build.properties:

<pre>
<code>
        # Project name for when building a default release.
        project.name = Example

        # Base name for the resulting .jar file.
        output.name = Example

        vendor.name = The.Berlin.Factor

        screen.size = Default

        # Symbols for the primary configuration.
        defined_symbols = MIDP2,CLDC11,RUNME

        # Main class - stays the same for all configurations.
        midlet.class = net.intensicode.Main

        # Primary configuration for normal Ant build.
        release.configurations = Example

        # Use this JAD file with - for example - a list of special MIDlet permissions.
        jad.template = Example.jad
</code>
</pre>

Override the WTK location in env.properties if necessary:

<pre>
<code>
        wtk.home = /usr/local/wtk
</code>
</pre>

Create a release.sh script for convenience:

<pre>
<code>
        ruby -Imodules/IntensiBuild/scripts modules/IntensiBuild/scripts/release.rb $*
</code>
</pre>

Create the JAD template:

<pre>
<code>
        MIDlet-Icon: /icon.png
        MIDlet-Version: ${version}
        MIDlet-Name: ${project.name}
        MIDlet-Vendor: ${vendor.name}
        MIDlet-Jar-URL: ${project.name}.jar
        MIDlet-1: ${project.name}, /icon.png, ${midlet.class}
        MIDlet-Permissions: javax.microedition.io.Connector.http,javax.microedition.io.Connector.https,javax.microedition.io.Connector.bluetooth.client,javax.microedition.io.Connector.comm,javax.microedition.io.Connector.socket,javax.microedition.io.Connector.datagram
</code>
</pre>

If you want to create a signed WebStart version using RunMe, you need to create a proper signing.properties file:

<pre>
<code>
        signing.keytool = /usr/local/jdk/bin/keytool
        signing.alias = intensicode
        signing.keypass = password
        signing.storepass = password
        signing.keystore = ${dir.intensibuild}/keystore.bin
        signing.dname = CN=intensicode, OU=it, O=intensicode, C=DE
</code>
</pre>

Make sure you ran <code>ant update_certificate</code>.

h1. Using the build system

Creating a debug/development build: <code>ant build</code>

Creating a default configuration release build: <code>ant release</code>

Creating a specific release: <code>./release.sh config/Example.rb</code>
